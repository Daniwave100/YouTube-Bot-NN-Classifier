I decided to hire a broker, even though I was skeptical at first, and I beat the market by more than 9%. I thought it was a fluke until it happened two years in a row, and so I‚Äôve been sticking to investing via an analyst.\\nYour invt-adviser must be really good, I hope it&#39;s okay to inquire if you&#39;re still collaborating with the same invt-adviser and how I can get in touch with them?\\nHer name is Kelley Annette can&#39;t divulge much.
