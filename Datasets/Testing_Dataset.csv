You can avoid excess spending and unnecessary luxury goods without â€œlooking poorâ€. Well-fitting clothes, good grooming, and classic/timeless taste can go a long way. Itâ€™s not like we have to decide between Gucci or â€œlook poorâ€. You can look very classy and upscale on a budget. The reason I say this is because I think some people are going too far in the opposite direction and risk coming across as unkempt or lazy. Even when my family was poor they taught me to look clean and presentable to the world. It had nothing to do with gaudy clothing or brand flexing. There is a middle ground where you donâ€™t have to â€œlook poorâ€ but you also donâ€™t have to spend excessively to achieve a nice look.",2024-10-09T00:06:12Z,0

2024-09-19T06:16:48Z,@JorgiHutse,_ecuAisJr-A,"In my opinion<,based on what I learned in my college macroeconomics class, lowering inflation through cutting interest rates could actually hurt the middle class because when the FED lowers rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, increasing demand and pushing prices up. While lower rates might stimulate the economy in the short term, they risk driving up inflation in the long run, as demand would outpace supply. If the FED continues to print money and keeps rates low, inflation could spiral out of control, and our economy could face instability. Historically, when the FED lowers rates, it may boost GDP temporarily, but it can lead to long-term inflationary pressures. Anyone feeling the impact of these economic shifts should consider long-term trading strategies to protect their assets. My advice to anyone feeling the heat in this inflation, just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 520k from day trading with   Francine Duguay in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish..",2024-09-19T06:16:48Z,1
