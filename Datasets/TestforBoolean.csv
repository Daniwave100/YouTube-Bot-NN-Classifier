2024-10-09T00:06:12Z,@IvanBustos,nGF4-8gRyn4,"I’ve seen a lot of these “look poor” videos, but I think many of them are missing a point. You can avoid excess spending and unnecessary luxury goods without “looking poor”. Well-fitting clothes, good grooming, and classic/timeless taste can go a long way. It’s not like we have to decide between Gucci or “look poor”. You can look very classy and upscale on a budget. The reason I say this is because I think some people are going too far in the opposite direction and risk coming across as unkempt or lazy. Even when my family was poor they taught me to look clean and presentable to the world. It had nothing to do with gaudy clothing or brand flexing. There is a middle ground where you don’t have to “look poor” but you also don’t have to spend excessively to achieve a nice look.",2024-10-09T00:06:12Z,0

2024-10-04T06:33:01Z,@peartreedu,nGF4-8gRyn4,"I understand the point about luxury brands often being seen as mere signals of disposable income, but I respectfully disagree with that simplistic view.

At its core, luxury should be about taste.

A true luxury brand doesn’t just broadcast wealth—it resonates with personal style and refinement.

It's about craftsmanship, uniqueness, and how well it aligns with the individual’s preferences and lifestyle.

When a luxury brand genuinely matches taste, it transcends its price tag, offering something more meaningful than status: a reflection of who you are.

While some people, particularly the newly wealthy, view luxury brands primarily as symbols of financial status, others recognize them as aligned with their personal ideals. For these individuals, it’s not just about showcasing wealth—it’s about selecting products that resonate with their sense of style, values, and the quality they appreciate. True luxury is about connection to taste and identity, not just economics.",2024-10-04T06:33:01Z,0

Doctors messed up his throat.  He should’ve sued that doctor so hard.  Love John!

The luxury is in not having debt and picking companies/clothing/furniture based on quality and craftsmanship, not a loud overly flashy brand. 

Most people know that those dressing up like they have money are doing it from a place on insecurity, so they usually get ignored, and then that person keeps buying even more to get compensated for the lack of attention and power they are feeling.

Driving this need for overconsumption and unsatisfactory.

The most powerful and rich people are usually rich from the heart and are kind and humble and wear shoes with holes in them and a simple navy blue t shirt but donate millions to charities and schools.

Graham already has status from being famous so he doesn't really have need for any additional status that status items would bring him. However, if you want to get status boost from wealth, you need to spend money on status items. People will talk about you, more girls will be interested in you, people will invite you to do more things. People want to come to your parties. You don't want to get insane with it and don't want to spend money you don't have though, that's just a recipe for disaster.",2024-10-02T23:04:22Z,0

The last best example I heard of was a beggar who made over 100K a year, but the IRS couldn't find him for the longest time cause he had no address. From my experience, most actual homeless people aren't begging for money, but looking for scraps and things to sell for food. Rarely do the actually go beg for money.",2024-10-04T06:02:04Z,0

2024-10-02T22:49:19Z,@AlhamdulillahInEverySituation,nGF4-8gRyn4,"I’m afraid you are wrong on one point, Graham. 

Money can, in fact, buy happiness. 

But only when it is spent on others.

Find someone truly in need. 

Perhaps a single-mother falling short on her rent payment for the month or an unhoused person who is hungry or an orphan from a war-torn country without shelter and assist them from your wealth. 

See what becomes of your happiness.

You see, the worldly pleasures of this life are fleeting. That is why the most important thing that any human being can buy with money is spending it in the way of helping those who are the most in need. The most vulnerable. 

And this is because the purpose of money is not just a tool for buying “options”, but its ultimate utility is found in alleviating the suffering of others.

Imagine, for a moment, a world where the very wealthy collectively used a portion of their great fortunes to help uplift the lives of the very poor. The sick, the destitute, the orphan, the disabled. To feed the hungry, to shelter the unhoused, and provide medicines for the sick. What a truly breathtaking world that would be. 

You see, God has given us all the resources on this earth we need to thrive. But He hasn’t divyed up the loot. That charge He has laid upon us. This is our ultimate test.

When we finally awaken to the Truth that Time itself is fleeting and that we are all born to die, with nothing that we have accumulated in this worldly life accompanying us to the grave, it is only then that we can see that the highest purpose for our wealth and for our time is to be used in service of God and humankind. It is only in such service do hearts truly find rest.",2024-10-02T22:49:19Z,0

Now in present day, many tech companies are cutting off 10% of their workforce which directly affects the housing.

2024-09-19T06:16:48Z,@JorgiHutse,_ecuAisJr-A,"In my opinion<,based on what I learned in my college macroeconomics class, lowering inflation through cutting interest rates could actually hurt the middle class because when the FED lowers rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, increasing demand and pushing prices up. While lower rates might stimulate the economy in the short term, they risk driving up inflation in the long run, as demand would outpace supply. If the FED continues to print money and keeps rates low, inflation could spiral out of control, and our economy could face instability. Historically, when the FED lowers rates, it may boost GDP temporarily, but it can lead to long-term inflationary pressures. Anyone feeling the impact of these economic shifts should consider long-term trading strategies to protect their assets. My advice to anyone feeling the heat in this inflation, just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 520k from day trading with   Francine Duguay in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish..",2024-09-19T06:16:48Z,1

Then, instead of letting the inflation work itself out… we hiked rates thousands of times higher than they were in the most massive pounding the Fed has ever given an economy.

I specifically told a coworker a day or two after the lockdown for Wuhan that this was a really big deal. Why? Because the Chinese communist party rules with the idea that they are making the economy grow for everyone in China. That is really important. So for them to lock down an entire major metro area screamed that something really bad was happening and they were willing to take extreme measures. I didn't have to believe what they were saying. I just had to understand the actions were extremely bad for their standing with their own population. If I could see that I'm 100% certain the government had a pile of analysts who could say that with much more authority and it likely took just a few weeks before plans were ready for how to handle the situation.

I’m saying that in order to have the inflation we saw there needs to be more than just an increase in available money supply or supply shortages.  Lowering rates hasn’t caused an uptick in inflation as we learned in the past as rates fell to zero with inflation saying near two percent.  In 2008 we also increased the money supply significantly with inflation still staying stable.  Recent history has shown that only a severely restricted supply disruption coupled with a massive increase in stimulus causing demand will cause hyperinflation in this system.

Lets look at food manufacturers: PFG, Tyson and Sysco's profit margins: PFG is 1.44%, Tyson is 1.43%, Sysco is 2.98%. exactly how is that ""price gouging""?? 

So it isnt like the manufacturers are these crazy greedy companies either. so where in the supply chain is this massive greed? go look at the 70s with Nixon, go look at Venezuela, go look at anywhere price controls were used, and you tell me where it worked.

Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few resources. I can't believe i have to say that on a Finance channel. stop printing money, stop with the handouts, reduce immigration into the country, and inflation will start going down.",2024-09-19T15:50:58Z,0
